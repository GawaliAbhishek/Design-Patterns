**Shallow Copy**:

A shallow copy of an object creates a new object and copies all the fields
 of the original object to the new object. However, if the fields of the original 
 object are reference types (e.g., arrays or objects), then only the references to 
 those fields are copied, not the actual objects themselves. This means both the original
  object and the shallow copy will still reference the same objects in memory.

**Deep Copy**:

A deep copy of an object creates a new object and recursively copies all the fields of the 
original object, including any objects referenced by the original object's fields. 
This means that a deep copy duplicates not only the original object but also any objects it references.



Let's illustrate these concepts with a simple example:

import java.util.Arrays;

class Person {
    String name;
    int[] scores;

    public Person(String name, int[] scores) {
        this.name = name;
        this.scores = scores;
    }
}

public class DeepCopyVsShallowCopy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] originalScores = {90, 85, 80};
        Person originalPerson = new Person("Alice", originalScores);

        // Shallow copy
        Person shallowCopyPerson = new Person(originalPerson.name, originalPerson.scores);

        // Deep copy
        int[] deepCopyScores = Arrays.copyOf(originalPerson.scores, originalPerson.scores.length);
        Person deepCopyPerson = new Person(originalPerson.name, deepCopyScores);

        // Modify original scores
        originalScores[0] = 100;

        // Print original, shallow copy, and deep copy scores
        System.out.println("Original scores: " + Arrays.toString(originalPerson.scores));
        System.out.println("Shallow copy scores: " + Arrays.toString(shallowCopyPerson.scores));
        System.out.println("Deep copy scores: " + Arrays.toString(deepCopyPerson.scores));
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Person` class with a `name` field and an `int` array `scores`. We create an original person object with some scores. Then we create a shallow copy and a deep copy of this object.

When we modify the `originalScores` array after creating the shallow and deep copies, you'll see that the shallow copy's scores are also modified because it shares the same reference to the `scores` array with the original object. However, the deep copy's scores remain unchanged because it has its own separate copy of the scores array.
